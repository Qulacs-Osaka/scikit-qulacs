# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# a list of builtin themes.
